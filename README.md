# Bus Schedule PWA

A Progressive Web App that provides real-time bus schedule information for users.

## Why?

I build this because the bus app that i'm currently using has these issues:

- Bus App not updating in real time
- Redundant clicks that can routes you to another page to select bus route

## Features

- Real-time bus schedule information
- User-friendly interface
- Responsive design and optimal viewing for **mobile devices**
- [Video Demo Here](https://youtube.com/shorts/fcdiq42dSrA)

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js
- RESTful APIs
- Bulma (CSS framework)
- TypeScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bus-schedule.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

3. Start the development server:

npm run dev

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`
