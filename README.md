# Bus Schedule PWA (SG Bussin')

A Progressive Web App that provides real-time bus schedule information for users.

## Why?

I build this because the bus app that i'm currently using has these issues:

- Bus App not updating in real time
- Redundant clicks that can routes you to another page to select bus route

## Features

- Real-time bus schedule information
- Responsive design and optimal viewing for **mobile devices**

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js
- REST API
- Bulma (CSS framework)
- TypeScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmotyl95/team_project
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`
